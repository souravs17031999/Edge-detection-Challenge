# Edge-detection-Challenge

# Project Objective : 
Create a page or tool which performs edge detection on a given image and, given a point, returns the distance from that point to the closest edge.    

# Approach :

* Using ```Canny edge detection```` (openCV) + ```KNN``` algorithm with ```Flask``` server.    
* Edge detection in the browser using ```tensorflow.js```    

# Getting started :
